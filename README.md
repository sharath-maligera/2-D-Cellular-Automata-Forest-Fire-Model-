# 2-D-Cellular-Automata-Forest-Fire-Model
- Implements a two-dimensional (d=2) (Cellular) Automaton on a 101 Ã— 82 sized, rectangular grid using a torus toplogy to manage the boundary of the grid. 
- Forest Fire Model:
- The user should set the probabilistic parameters:
  - probablility of spontaneous growth 'p'
  - probablility of spontaneous fire 'f'
  - probablility of induced growth 'q'
- The programs writes the number of cells for each state (Ashes, Tree, Fire) for each time step into a file (three values per line, ASCII format, separated by blanks).
